# FOMO Arena Root Structure Setup

This commit ensures the root structure is perfectly organized:

1. README.md      → Project description and instructions
2. LICENSE        → MIT License (or your chosen license)
3. .gitignore     → Node / React / general ignores
4. index.html     → Main entry for GitHub Pages
5. app.js         → Frontend JS logic connected to smart contract
6. style.css      → Styling for the app

All files are in the root folder.
File names are case-sensitive and ready for deployment.
